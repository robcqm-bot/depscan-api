Alembic migrations for DepScan API.

Alembic is fully configured. The initial migration (001) captures the complete
schema for Fases 0-3 including the stripe_subscription_id column added in Fase 2.

== First deploy (fresh database) ==

    # Apply all migrations to an empty database
    alembic upgrade head

== Development (SQLite / test DB) ==

    # create_all() is still called at startup as a fallback for dev/test environments
    # that don't run alembic.

== Adding a new migration ==

    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe what changed"
    alembic upgrade head

== Rollback ==

    alembic downgrade -1      # one step back
    alembic downgrade base    # full rollback (drops all tables)

== Check current revision ==

    alembic current
    alembic history --verbose
